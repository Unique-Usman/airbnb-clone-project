### Importance of User-Friendly Design
A well-designed booking system reduces friction in the user journey, increases conversion rates, and improves customer satisfaction. Clear navigation, intuitive interfaces, and responsive design are critical for success.

### Figma Design Specifications

#### Color Styles:
- Primary: #FF5A5F
- Secondary: #008489
- Background: #FFFFFF

### Importance of Identifying Design Properties
Understanding design properties from mockups ensures consistency throughout the application, speeds up development, and helps maintain the intended user experience. By documenting color schemes, typography, and component patterns, we create a single source of truth that all team members can reference during implementation.

| Payments | - id (PK)<br>- booking_id (FK)<br>- amount<br>- payment_date<br>- status | - Belongs to one booking |

## Feature Breakdown

### User Management
The user management system handles authentication, authorization, and profile management. It enables users to register, log in, update their profiles, and manage their account settings, ensuring secure access to the application.

### Property Management
This feature allows property owners to list their properties, update details, manage availability, and set pricing. It forms the core offering of the platform by providing a comprehensive interface for property owners to showcase their spaces.

### Booking System
The booking system facilitates the reservation process, allowing guests to select dates, review availability, and confirm bookings. It integrates with the payment system to ensure secure transactions and provides booking management for both guests and hosts.

### Review and Rating System
This feature enables users to leave feedback and ratings for properties they've stayed at. It builds trust in the platform by providing authentic user experiences and helps future guests make informed decisions.

### Search and Filter Functionality
The search system allows users to find properties based on location, price range, amenities, and availability. It enhances user experience by providing relevant results and helping users discover properties that meet their specific criteria.

### Payment Processing
This feature handles secure payment transactions between guests and hosts. It supports various payment methods, ensures financial security, and manages refunds and cancellations according to the platform's policies.

## API Security

### Authentication and Authorization
Implementing JWT-based authentication ensures that only authorized users can access protected endpoints. This protects user data and prevents unauthorized access to sensitive operations like bookings and payments.

### Data Validation and Sanitization
All input data is validated and sanitized to prevent injection attacks and ensure data integrity. This protects the application from malicious inputs that could compromise the system or expose user data.

### Rate Limiting and Throttling
API rate limiting prevents abuse by limiting the number of requests from a single source within a specified timeframe. This protects against brute force attacks and ensures fair usage of system resources.

### HTTPS Encryption
All API communications use HTTPS encryption to protect data in transit. This ensures that sensitive information like payment details and personal data remains confidential and cannot be intercepted.

### Regular Security Audits
Periodic security assessments identify and address potential vulnerabilities before they can be exploited. This proactive approach maintains the overall security posture of the application.

## CI/CD Pipeline

Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines automate the building, testing, and deployment processes of the application. This approach ensures code quality, reduces manual errors, and enables faster delivery of new features and bug fixes.

### Tools and Technologies
- **GitHub Actions**: Automates testing and deployment workflows triggered by code changes
- **Docker**: Creates consistent environments across development, testing, and production
- **Automated Testing**: Runs unit, integration, and end-to-end tests to validate code changes
- **Code Quality Checks**: Enforces coding standards and identifies potential issues through static analysis
